## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

 **Foodie Fiestas** is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) web application that caters to culinary enthusiasts and food lovers. With Foodie Fiestas, users can explore a world of gastronomy. 

On this platform, users can participate in events, collaborate with others, and also contribute by adding and editing event details.

> This application follows the REST architectural style, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive experience for viewing, participating in, adding, and editing food events.


 

<!-- Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
